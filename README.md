## Setup

1. Fork the project

3. Write some posts

If you want to test locally on your machine, do the following steps also:

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
2. Clone the forked repo on your machine
3. Enter the cloned folder via terminal and run `bundle install`
4. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open it in your browser: `http://localhost:4000`
6. Do you want an admin panel to edit your posts? You can install this plugin [jekyll-admin](https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-admin/).

## Settings

You must fill some informations on `_config.yml` to customize your site.
